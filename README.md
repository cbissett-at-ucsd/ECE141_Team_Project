## Connecting to Internet
### Hello World 
Purchase a domain name and upload a docker container to run a simple hello world file

**Tasks to Overcome**
-  Global hello world
-  buy Domain
   - possible website names
   - notramsin.com
   - ramsin.tech
   - ECE141RuffRiders.com
-  load files
-  run docker container on server
-  fix python code to work with internet

### Hello Webserving
Try and load assignment two on the server and change the domain adresses to get the thing to work
may have to switch to a different serving program that has better tutorials

- load files
- adjust links in the python files
- figure out problems?
